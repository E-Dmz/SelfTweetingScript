# SelfTweetingScript
## How it started

![Original](Original/Original.png)

*For this you need the keys for a Twitter API, a screenshot of the code.*

## Next challenge
**making a truely recursive script,** in other words, a script that tweets itself. Here is the one I came up with:
![Normal](Normal.png)

*Of course, you need a module (keys) with the keys to your api*

## Next challenge
**making that script as short as possible.** 69 characters is the shorter I could imagine:
![Minimal](Minimal.png)

*The keys module does not contain a dictionnary anymore, but a list (for an obvious reason!)*

If your know how to make it even shorter (preferably without having the "twitter" package renamed as "t" outside of the script... which i could probably do...), please let me know!
