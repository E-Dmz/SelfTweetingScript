# SelfTweetingScript
## First step

![Original](Original/Original.png)

* For this you need: 
  * the keys for a Twitter API, in a dictionnary inside a module named keys.py 
  * the screenshot to be displayed (here named Demo.png)

## Next challenge
**making a truely recursive script,** in other words, a script that tweets itself. Here is the one I came up with:

## Last challenge
**making the script as short as possible.** 69 characters is the shorter I could imagine:
![Minimal](Minimal.png)

* The dictionnary in the keys module was replaced by a list (to have it unpacked as `*k` instead of `**k`)

If your know how to make it even shorter (preferably without having the "twitter" package renamed as "t" outside of the script... which i could probably do...), please let me know!
